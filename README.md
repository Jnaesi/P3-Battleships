## Deployment

* The site was deployed to Heroku pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
* When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

* You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`
* If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.
* Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.
